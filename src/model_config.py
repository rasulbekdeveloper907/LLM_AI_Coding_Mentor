"""Lesson 7 - the design of our model.

There is no model in this file. There is no attention, no transformer block,
no training loop. There are only the DECISIONS, written down, plus enough
arithmetic to find out whether those decisions are affordable.

    Architecture
          |
    Parameter count
          |
    Memory requirement
          |
    Training feasibility

That chain is the whole lesson. A model you cannot fit in your GPU is not a
design, it is a wish - and the only way to find out before burning ten hours
of compute is to multiply the numbers first.

Lesson 8 will read this config and build the real model from it.
